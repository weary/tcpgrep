tcpgrep
=======

Search through tcp-streams with regular expressions.
Tcpgrep reconstructs all tcpstreams from packets in a pcap file and applies a
regular expression. Matched text is printed to stdout.
Optionally writes a new pcap with only the streams that contained matches.


Examples
--------

Get all http-requests from a pcap (question marks for non-greedy match):
  ``tcpgrep '^\w+? /[^ *]+? .*?HTTP/1.1$' test.pcap``

Print full http headers for GET-requests with certain header:
  ``tcpgrep '^GET .*?^Host: testhost.com.*?\r\n\r\n' test.pcap --no-trailing-newline``

Create a pcap with only the requests for a certain host:
  ``tcpgrep '^Host: testhost.com$' test.pcap -w out.pcap -q``

Print content of entire tcp-stream:
  ``tcpgrep '.*' test.pcap``


Remarks
-------

Order of matched results can be messy if the input pcap is not clean (for
example, due to packetloss, incomplete snaplen or skewed rx/tx). Use the -t
option to add timestamps to the matches and sort the results if order is
important.
